== Welcome to Tagglynx

TaggLynx is web app for Google chrome, and soon to be all browsers, that combines the connectivity of a social network with the focus and direction of a discussion board. TaggLynx takes the process of discovering new content and new people to a whole new level. We do this by offering a sidebar that attaches to the side of the browser. This sidebar allows our users to manage their life around them; their social networks, mail, RSS feeds, etc. through tabs on the top of the sidebar, while also providing a tool to more efficiently integrate their browsing and networking. The TaggLynx tab gives our users a commenting system that displays content that is always related to the subject matter of the current page. Imagine: no more having to switch between webpageâ€™s to keep up to date with your notifications, no more having to scroll down a page in order to see what others think! There are as many use-cases for TaggLynx as there are websites; the possibilities are endless. The bottom line is that no matter the interests are, we strongly believe TaggLynx will be for everyone!
